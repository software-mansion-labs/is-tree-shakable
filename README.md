# `is-tree-shakable`

![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/is-tree-shakable)

This is a command-line tree-shakability checker for JavaScript packages. Compared to alternatives, it not only reports whether a package is
tree-shakable but also pinpoints the root causes of non-tree-shakability in the JavaScript or TypeScript&nbsp;source.

## Getting started

1. Ensure that your packageâ€™s `package.json` file specifies [`"main"`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#main) or&nbsp;[`"module"`](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/#publishing-es-modules).

2. If your package is built, enable source-map generation. For TypeScript, this is done via&nbsp;[`"sourceMap"`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#sourceMap).

## Usage

1. If your package is built, run the build&nbsp;step.

2. Run `is-tree-shakable` in the package&nbsp;root:

   ```sh
   npx is-tree-shakable
   ```
